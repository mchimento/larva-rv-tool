<h2>News</h2>
<p>This is essentially the release history.</p>

<p>Release v0.92_build20040318
<ul>
<li>The re-inported HTTPServer - server core had been shown to be not MacOS8-compliant. This has been fixed (new file names, no more setProperty-Methods which are not included in Java 1.1</li>
<li>New MacOS file-system functions: type and creator from downloaded files are remembered and restored upon upload. File types are matched with file extensions automatically and assigned also for previously 'unknown' (not learned-by-download) files. These extensions are disabled when the server is not running on MacOS.</li>
<li>Better catch-up of exceptions that occur for special not-supported system functions.</li>
<li>Patch for weird '%20' occurrence after character conversion.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Release v0.91_build20040309
<ul>
<li>First release published under the GPL</li>
<li>The server technology from the version 0.9 had been taken to code an abstracted server library which was then
the basis for the HTTPProxy project, where the server core was extended and further improved. This version of the
FTP server now includes the re-inserted server core from the HTTPProxy project.</li>
</ul></p>

to have the v0.9 version number as AnomicFTPD_v0.90_build20031201.tar.gz.</li>
<li>That release can be considered as very stable and working on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux, MacOS X, Psion and 68K Macs.</li>
